/**
 * This is a simplified version of the *random tree* data structure
 * used by KaSim (see [[https://github.com/jkrivine/KaSim/blob/master/dataStructures/random_tree.ml]]).
 *
 * Unlike the version used by KaSim, instances of this class represent
 * fixed-size random trees, that is, the size of the tree is fixed at
 * creation and can not be modified afterwards.  However, instances of
 * this tree remain mutable in that the weights of the leaves of the
 * random tree can be updated after creation.
 *
 * Use case:
 *
 * {{{
 *   // Create a random tree
 *   val rt = RandomTree(List(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), new scala.util.Random)
 *
 *   // Histogram of random trials
 *   val hist1 = new Array[Int](3)
 *   for (_ <- 0 until 10000) hist1(rt.nextRandom._1) += 1
 *   hist1 // e.g. hist1: Array[Int] = Array(1657, 3252, 5091)
 *
 *   // Histogram of biased trials
 *   val hist2 = new Array[Int](3)
 *   rt(2) = Double.PositiveInfinity
 *   for (_ <- 0 until 10000) hist2(rt.nextRandom._1) += 1
 *   hist2 // hist2: Array[Int] = Array(0, 0, 10000)
 * }}}
 *
